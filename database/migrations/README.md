# Database Migrations

**All migrations have been consolidated into `../complete_schema.sql`.**

For new installations, use the complete schema file instead of individual migrations.

## Status

### âœ… All Migrations Consolidated
All database changes are now included in `complete_schema.sql`:
- âœ… `ended_at` field and status constraint updates
- âœ… pgvector extension and embedding columns  
- âœ… All security fixes and view corrections
- âœ… Core tables, security tables, and functions

### ðŸŽ¯ Migration Directory Cleaned
All files have been removed or relocated:
- Migration files â†’ Consolidated into `../complete_schema.sql`
- Test files â†’ Moved to `../test_queries/`

## For Existing Installations

**Recommended approach**: Drop your current database and recreate with `complete_schema.sql` for a clean state.

**If you must preserve data**:
1. Export your existing data
2. Run `complete_schema.sql` to create clean schema  
3. Import your data back

The individual migration approach is no longer supported since all changes have been consolidated.
