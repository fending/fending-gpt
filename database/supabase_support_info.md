# Supabase Linter Cache Issue - Support Information

## Issue Description
Supabase database linter is showing persistent SECURITY DEFINER view warnings even after views have been correctly recreated without SECURITY DEFINER property.

## Evidence of Correct Fix
1. **Verification Query Results**: 
   ```sql
   -- This query returns NO ROWS (confirming no SECURITY DEFINER)
   SELECT viewname, 'HAS SECURITY DEFINER' as issue
   FROM pg_views 
   WHERE viewname IN ('daily_session_stats', 'popular_questions')
   AND schemaname = 'public'
   AND definition LIKE '%SECURITY DEFINER%';
   -- Result: No rows returned ✓
   ```

2. **View Definitions**: Views are correctly created with SECURITY INVOKER (default)
   ```sql
   SELECT viewname, LEFT(definition, 100) as definition_start
   FROM pg_views 
   WHERE viewname IN ('daily_session_stats', 'popular_questions');
   -- Result: Shows standard CREATE VIEW syntax without SECURITY DEFINER ✓
   ```

3. **Views Function Correctly**: Both views return data and work as expected

## Persistent Linter Warnings
Despite the fixes, linter continues to show:
```json
{
  "name": "security_definer_view",
  "title": "Security Definer View", 
  "level": "ERROR",
  "detail": "View `public.daily_session_stats` is defined with the SECURITY DEFINER property"
}
```

## Attempted Fixes
1. ✅ Recreated views with `DROP VIEW ... CASCADE` and `CREATE VIEW`
2. ✅ Used conditional logic migration to check and fix
3. ✅ Applied nuclear approach with temporary views
4. ✅ Updated view comments and ran ANALYZE
5. ✅ Waited for cache refresh (multiple hours)

## Request
Please refresh/clear the database linter cache for these views:
- `public.daily_session_stats`  
- `public.popular_questions`

The views have been correctly fixed but the linter cache appears to be stuck on the old definitions.
